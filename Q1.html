             language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup
              language is used to define the text document within tag which defines 
              the structure of web pages. HTML is a markup language that is used by

        <p>
            C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis
            Ritchie as a system programming language to write operating system.
            The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, 
            simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language 
            suitable for system programming like operating system or compiler
            development.

                            Java has been one of the most popular programming language
                            for many years. Java is Object Oriented. However it is not
                            considered as pure object oriented as it provides support 
                            for primitive data types (like int, char, etc) The Java 
                            codes are first compiled into byte code (machine independent code).
                            Then the byte code is run on Java Virtual
                            Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.
